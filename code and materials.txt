It seems like you might be referring to a ratio or feature in a fake profile detection dataset that involves the number of numeric characters in a username relative to the total length of the username. If that's the case, you could calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Nums/Length Username} = \frac{\text{Number of Numeric Characters in Username}}{\text{Length of Username}} \]

Here's a breakdown:

- **Number of Numeric Characters in Username:** Count the total number of numeric characters (0-9) in the username.
- **Length of Username:** Calculate the total length of the username, including all characters (letters, numbers, symbols).

Dividing the number of numeric characters by the total length provides a ratio that represents the proportion of numeric characters in the username. This can be a useful feature for fake profile detection, as certain patterns or anomalies in the usage of numeric characters might be indicative of automated or generated usernames often associated with fake profiles.

As an example, if the username is "FakeUser123," where there are 3 numeric characters and the total length is 11, the calculation would be:

\[ \text{Nums/Length Username} = \frac{3}{11} \]

This would result in a numerical value representing the ratio of numeric characters to the total length of the username. Analyzing such features can contribute to the development of effective models for fake profile detection.
